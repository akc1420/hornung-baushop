/**
 * From version 0.2.1 to 0.3.0 the support for Green-Blue migrations was removed. That means that the destructive part
 * of migrations have been merged into to non-destructive part. (Commit: f9b06fec1902027df88dab9cc8b6db039f679227)
 * Unfortunately Shopware 6 does not enforce the destructive migrations to be executed before a plugin update. That lead
 * to the situation that the update from v0.2.1 to 0.3.0 was executed on systems that did not perform any
 * destructive migrations yet. For that systems the destructive part of the migrations now will never be executed
 * because it was moved to the non-destructive part. And the non-destructive part already did run.
 *
 * To fix this issue on the respective systems, this migration runs the former destructive part of all the affected
 * migrations. Since this migration will also run on systems that DID run the destructive migrations or on systems where
 * the plugin is installed completely from scratch, the atomic parts of this migration have to be idempotent.
