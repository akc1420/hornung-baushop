/**
 * With DHL BCP API 3.1 a new value "sale-of-goods" was introduces for the type of a shipment in the customs
 * information. Formerly this type was represented by type "other" and comment "goods for sale". This also was the
 * default value in the configuration when installing DHL.
 * This migration automatically converts settings with type "other" and comment "goods for sale" to type "sale-of-goods"
 * with no comment to save the user some manual re-configuration.
